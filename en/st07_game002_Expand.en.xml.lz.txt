This scene of tragedy is*
once again sealed in silence.<press>
The tragedy five years ago...*
and the tragedy tonight...<press>
<blue>(I wonder where the*
little lady is now...?)<black><press>
If only I could put a smile*
back on her face... before*
the day dawns.<press>
<blue>(But I won't find*
the answers here.)<black><press>
I'd better follow*
my own leads.
