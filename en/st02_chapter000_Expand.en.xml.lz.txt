Yet another gunshot rings*
out in the lonely junkyard*
on the edge of town.<space>
The sound gives me the feeling*
a new death will be waiting*
on the other side of the line...<press>
Apparently, I'm not the*
only one the Reaper's*
interested in tonight.<space>
But as long as there's anything*
I can do about it, I don't plan*
on letting anybody else die.
