I really should pay the*
kidnappers' hideout a visit.<space>
After all, if we want the justice*
minister to come around, we*
have to solve this problem first...<press>
I feel like I'm slowly moving*
away from my own mystery...<space>
But I'm not the kind of guy who can*
abandon a little lady in trouble.<space>
So I guess I'm in this for*
a little while longer.
